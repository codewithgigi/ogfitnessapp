id: "bodyweight-squat"
instructions: "Start with feet about shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward, back straight. Squeeze the glutes and pull the shoulder blades toward the spine. Keep eyes forward and a neutral head posture. Push the feet apart as if trying to spread the floor, and descend as though youâ€™re sitting into a chair; knees should track in line with toes."
